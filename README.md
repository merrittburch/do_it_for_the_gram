Storing my Instagram posts about plants. Trying my best to correctly ID everything I find, I'm not a real botanist.


Files and folders are organized by:
- Phylum (angiosperms)
- Class (monocots or dicots)
	- order_family_genus_species.txt

Remember: King Phillip came over for good spaghetti (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species)
