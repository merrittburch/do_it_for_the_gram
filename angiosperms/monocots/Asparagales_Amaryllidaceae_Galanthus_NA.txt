Snowdrop flowers (genus Galanthus) appear in early spring (~March) and are native to Europe and the Middle East. The attractive drooping white, bell-shaped flower with green petals are one of the earliest spring bulbs to emerge through the snow and bloom. During World War II, the American Military police were nicknamed â€˜snowdropsâ€™ by the British due to their white helmets, gloves, and gaiters against green uniforms ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸
