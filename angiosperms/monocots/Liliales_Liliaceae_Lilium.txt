Going through my backlog of photos and saw these lovely orange lilies I saw in South Dakota. Lilies (genus Lilium) are perennial herbaceous plants that grow from bulbs, native to temperate northern hemisphere. Lily bulbs are used worldwide for different meals. In the Pacific Northwest  the Coast Salish and Nuu-chah-nulth peoples steam, boil or pit-cook Lilium columbianum (not the lily picture here) and use them in soup with meat or fish. They are described as having a bitter, pepper taste.
