Another backlog photo of orange tulips from South Dakota. Tulips (genus Tulipa) are perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (i.e. they grow from bulbs and store their energy in bulbs). Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia but are now found worldwide. Cultivation of tulips began in Persia in ~10th century and today the Netherlands is the worldâ€™s main producer of tulips producing 3 billion bulbs annually!
