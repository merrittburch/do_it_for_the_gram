The Crocus genius contains about 90 different species of perennials. The lilac crocuses pictured here in March have not fully bloomed yet, when they do bloom they will form a single, cup-shaped flower arising from a belowground storage corm. Crocuses are tiny plants only reaching 8-12 inches in height.
Fun fact: the red Crocus sativus stigmas and styles (not pictured here) produces the spice saffron, the most valuable spice by weight ðŸŒ±ðŸŒºðŸŒ¼
