The yellow Trout-lily (Erythronium americanum), also known as the dogtooth violet, is a small perennial plant common to eastern North America that blooms in early March through May. It is best recognized by the brown or purple mottled leaves and attractive nodding yellow flower. The distinctive spotting on the leaves is how the trout-lily gets its common name, from the similar patterning on freshwater trout. 🌼🌱🐟
