Lilacs (genus Syringa) are a group of perennial woody plants native to southeastern Europe and eastern Asia. Lilacs were first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist known as the “father of modern taxonomy”. The common name lilac is originally from the Persian word for ‘bluish’, the scientific name Syringa originates from the Ancient Greek word ‘syrinx’ meaning pipe/tube referring to the hollow branches of one of the 12 lilac species.
