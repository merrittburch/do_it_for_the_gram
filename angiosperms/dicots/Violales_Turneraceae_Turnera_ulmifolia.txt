The ramgoat dashalong or yellow alder (Turnera ulmifolia) is native to Mexico, Central America and several islands in the West Indies. Turnera ulmifolia typically grows as a weed and is seen as invasive in multiple tropical parts of the world. Like almost every plant, Turnera ulmifolia is polyploid with allopolyploid (chromosome sets from different species) and autopolyploid (all chromosome sets from the same species) species ranging from 2X-8X.
