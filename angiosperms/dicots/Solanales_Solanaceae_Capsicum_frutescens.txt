Hawaiian chili peppers (Capsicum frutescens var. Hawaiian pepper) are similar to habanero peppers on the Scoville heat scale coming in at 200,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHUs). These perennial shrubs produce hundreds of colorful, upright peppers on mature plants. It is thought that these chilies along with mangos were brought to Hawaii at the end of the 18th century by the Spanish horticulturalist Don Francisco de Paul Marin.The center of diversity for the Capsicum genus is in Bolivia and pepper plants were thought to be domesticated around the same time as many major crops roughly 10,000 years ago in South America.
