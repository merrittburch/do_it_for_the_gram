Dahlias are bushy, perennial plants with tuberous roots native to Mexico. Dahlias are the national flower of Mexico where they were used by the Aztecs to treat epilepsy or create water pipes from the hollow stems.The wide variation in dahlias colors and shapes are thought to arise from having an octoploid genome (have eight copies of their genome rather than the human or corn who have 2 copies)!
