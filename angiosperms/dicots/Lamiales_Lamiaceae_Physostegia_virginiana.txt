Physostegia virginiana, also known as the Obedient Plant or False Dragonhead, is a perennial member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) native to North America. Members of the Physostegia genus are nicknamed ‘obedient’ plants because each individual flower, when pushed, will stay in that position temporarily as if it was hinged.
