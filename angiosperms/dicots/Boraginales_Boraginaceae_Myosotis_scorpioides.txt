The True Forget-Me-Not flowers (Myosotis scorpioides) live in wet areas such as woodlands or streams. The genus name myosotis, originally described by Carl Linnaeus, is derived from Greek for how the foliage resembles a mouse’s ear. The species name scorpioides refers to how the unfurling on the stems looks like a scorpion’s tail. Myosotis species have pentamerous (=number of component parts in a flower) actinomorphic (=floral symmetry) flowers with 5 sepals and petals.
