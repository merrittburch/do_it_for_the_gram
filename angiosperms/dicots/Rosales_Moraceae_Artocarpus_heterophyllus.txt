Jackfruit trees (Artocarpus heterophyllus) are in the Moraceae family with fig and mulberry trees and originated between southern India and Malaysia. Mature jackfruit trees produce anywhere from ~200-500 fruits per year that grow from long, thick stems on the trunk. The jackfruit fruit can weigh 10-25 kg (22-55 pounds!) and consist of a gummy shell enclosing hundreds of individual flowers, also known as collective fruits or multiple fruits, similar to pineapples or mulberries. The bright yellow jackfruit flesh encloses 100-500 large seeds per fruit that tastes incredibly sweet. The name common name ‘jackfruit’ originates from a Scottish botanist named William Jack, who worked for the East India Company.
