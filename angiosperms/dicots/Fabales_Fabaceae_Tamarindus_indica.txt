Tamarind trees (Tamarindus indica) are a major staple in Thai cuisine. Young tamarind leaves can be used in soups and the pod-like fruit is used to add sweetness and tartness to dishes. Although a member of the Fabaceae family with legumes, beans, peas and ~19k other species, tamarind trees do not fix nitrogen. Thought to be indigenous to tropical Africa, tamarind trees have since moved to tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Pictured here is my grandpa next to the tamarind tree he has watched grow since he was little at his hometown Bhuddist temple.
