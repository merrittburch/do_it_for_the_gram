Witch hazel is a species of flowering shrub in the genus Hamamelis. Witch hazel blooms in early spring, showcasing bright yellow ribbon-shaped flowers. The reddish base of these flowers is the calyx, the outermost â€˜wrappingâ€™ of the flower before it blooms. North Eastern native tribes boiled witch hazel stems and used the resulting solution on the skin to reduce inflammation, ward off infections, and reduce irritation ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¼
