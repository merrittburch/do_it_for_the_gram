A Linaria vulgaris, also known as the common toadflax, yellow toadflax, or my favorite name: butter-and-eggs flower. Toadflax is native to Siberia and Central Asia but is now common in North America in ‘distrubed’ areas such as roadsides, gravel pits, and overgrazed rangelands. Toadflax was introduced to North America in the late 1600s as an ornamental plant with medicinal properties.
