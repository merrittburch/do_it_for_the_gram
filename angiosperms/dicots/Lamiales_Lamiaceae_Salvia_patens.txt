Gentian Sage or spreading sage (Salvia patens), a perennial native to Mexico, was popularized by English gardener William Robinson who praised the plant in his 1933 edition of The English Flower Garden, stating that: “doubtless, the most brilliant in cultivation, being surpassed by and equalled by few other [garden] flowers”. The Gentian family is known for its trumpet shaped flowers, many of which are bright blue.
