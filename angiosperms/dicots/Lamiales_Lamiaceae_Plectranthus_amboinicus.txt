Tiger’s ear (Plectranthus amboinicus), also known as Mexican mint, is a semi-succulent perennial plant that smells and tastes a lot like oregano. The genus name Plectranthus is Greek, “plectron” meaning spur and “anthos” meaning flower. The species name, amboinicus is named after Ambon Island in Indonesia where it was first described. This plant is used in so many cultures that there is a scientific paper that includes ~50 of the different translations! The first two photos are of a Tiger's ear plant I bought in Ithaca, the last is the plant in my grandparents garden in Thailand. Tiger’s ear is a staple in many Thai soups 🌱🌱🌱
