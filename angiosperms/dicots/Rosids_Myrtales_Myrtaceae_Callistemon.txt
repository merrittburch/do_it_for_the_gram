A red bottlebrush (genus Callistemon) I saw in Thailand. Members of the Callistemon genus, who are endemic to Australia, were first described in 1814 by Socttish botanist Robert Brown who noted that flowers of the Callistemon genus looked similar to Metrosideros flowers (aka 'Ohi'a lehua for my Hawaiian colleagues).
